Using a carefully chosen range of fabrics my cushions are each unique in design. Materials can include cottons, silks, man-made fibers, ribbons, embellishments and trims. Some fabrics are hand painted or dyed, some are remnants, some are recycled and some are vintage. Indian block prints, indigo and batik samples, sari fabrics and woven swatches can also be included within designs. Each individual design is carefully pieced and stitched to create a cushion rich in colour and decorative style. Motifs are applied which have been inspired by the landscape, animals, colour and patterns of Africa.

Sizes vary so each cushion contains its own polyester cushion pad. A zip opening enables the pad to be removed and the cushion washed. As each cushion contains a mix of different fibers and types it is advised that cushions are independently hand washed in warm water to avoid shrinkage or colour loss. A cool iron should be used and care taken to avoid ironing any sections of ribbon.
