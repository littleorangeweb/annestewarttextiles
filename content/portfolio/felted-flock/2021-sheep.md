Wet felting is an age old, long established textile technique, needle felting in contrast is a relatively 'new' textile process. The first needle felting machines appeared in America in the 1800's and single needle felting has since grown in popularity, particularly in the craft activities of more contemporary times. It's an easy process to master and needs few tools; a barbed needle and a handful of fleece is enough to get you started. Fibers are stabbed and teased with a needle to create a compact, stable fabric of versatility.

My needle felting is sculptural in nature and uses natural wool from a variety of sheep breeds for the creation of animals. In these sheep and lambs fleece from Devon, Jacob, Wensleydale, Bluefaced Leicester and merino breeds are manipulated and compacted to create a range of textile characters, each with a distinct personality.
