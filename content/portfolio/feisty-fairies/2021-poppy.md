Poppy is dressed in warm colours and inspired by the wild flower meadows and fields of summer. She has been handcrafted from a variety of beautiful fabrics, ribbons and trims. Her materials have been selected with care from a range of cottons, man-made firers, nets and dyed yarns. Her face is hand painted.

Poppy is not a toy but an individual textile character wit her own personality. Like a traditional puppet she has ribbons attached to her wrists and the top of her head. When these are manipulated she can be encouraged to move.

Poppy's wings are created from net and do contain wire; the ends can be sharp!
