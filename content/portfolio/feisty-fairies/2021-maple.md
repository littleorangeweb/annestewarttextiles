Inspired by the colours of the changing seasons, Maple is an autumn fairy who has been hand crafted from a variety of beautiful fabrics, ribbons and trims. Her materials have been selected with care from a range of cottons, soft wool, man-made fibers and dyed yarns. Some come from recycled sources and some are vintage. Her face is hand painted.

Maple is not a toy but an individual textile character with a personality all of her own. Like a traditional puppet she has ribbons attached to her wrists and to her head. When these are manipulated she can be encouraged to move. 

Maple's wings are constructed from net and contain wire, the ends can be sharp!
