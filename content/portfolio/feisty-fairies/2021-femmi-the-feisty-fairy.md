Inspired by the bloom on Spring flowering trees, Cherry blossom is a feisty fairy who has been handcrafted from a variety of beautiful fabrics, ribbons and trims. Her materials have been selected with care from a range of cottons, silks, man-made fibers, net and dyed yarns. Some come from recycled sources and some are vintage. Her face is hand painted.

Cherry Blossom is not a toy but an individual textile character with a personality all of her own. Like a traditional puppet she has ribbons attached to her hands and head she can move  her arms as these are manipulated.
