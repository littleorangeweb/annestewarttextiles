Inspired by the bluebells that cover the woodland floor in late spring,Bluebell is a feisty fairy who has been handcrafted from a variety of beautiful fabrics, ribbons and trims. Her materials have been selected with care from a range of cottons, man-made fibers, net, lace and dyed yarns.  Some come from recycled sources and some are vintage. Her face is hand painted.

Bluebell is not a toy but an individual textile character with her own personality. Like traditional puppets she has ribbons attached to her head and wrists. When these are pulled or manipulated she can be helped move. 

Bluebell's wings are made from net and contain wire, the points can be sharp!
