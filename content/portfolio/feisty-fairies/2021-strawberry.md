Strawberry is a summer fairy who has been handcrafted from a variety of beautiful fabrics, ribbons, buttons and trims. Her materials have been selected with care from a range of cottons, man-made fibers, net, lace and dyed yarns. Some come from recycled sources and some are vintage. Her face is hand painted.

Strawberry is not a toy but an individual textile character with her own personality. Like a traditional puppet she has ribbons attached to her wrists and the top of her head. When these are manipulated she can be encouraged to move. Her wings are created from net and do contain wire; the ends can be sharp!
