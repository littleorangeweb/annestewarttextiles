Trained in textiles and fashion and enriched by the diversity of teaching art and design for too many years in the classroom, my own work reflects an eclectic mix of colour, surface imagery and texture. Essentially a weaver, but with an affinity for the use of a sewing machine and an over enthusiastic habit of collecting fabrics, yarns and threads, my creations are rich in their visual palette and decorative in content and design. Landscapes and the natural world are underlying themes with stitched and dyed fabric ctudies and 'thread paintings' of gardens, the South West coastline, Scottish islands, Isles of Scilly and inland waterways recurring themes.

Applied traditional, recycled and vibrant fabrics are compiled to create cushions and quilts and textile characters such as feisty fairies and sprites are conjured from off-cuts. Lavendar bags and stitched cards show attention to detail in their individual combinations of thread, fibre and fabric. Wool, alpaca, mohair and silk yarns mix, blend and intertwine in tactile knitted scarves. The wool from local and rare breed sheep provide the raw material for a growing flock of needle felted sheep.
